                <p class="description">Built using <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, and <em>JavaScript</em>, this project tracks assignments and displays a bar showing how much time is left until the due date. The purpose of this project was to give students a way to visualize the amount of assignments they have and easily track what needs to be done. This project really pushed me to use full stack concepts I learned in previous courses. Data is stored in a <em>PostgreSQL</em> backend and I used the <em>Flask API</em> written in <em>Python</em> for handling requests.</p>

                <p class="description">This school project was built using <em>Angular</em> and <em>Typescript</em> for a responsive front end, with a <em>Java RESTful</em> back end. For this assignment, we were tasked to create a non-profit site for a prospective organization. We chose to make a website where members of the community could purchase school supplies for teachers who may need them. This project helped me learn to utilize <em>Agile Methodologies</em>, and collaborating effectively with a team. <br><br> The most important things I learned from this project was how to use tools like <em>Trello</em>, <em>Git</em> <i>(and branches!)</i>, and writing good documentation on Object Oriented Concepts.</p>

                <p class="description">Built with <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, and <em>JavaScript</em>, this was a quick personal project I built to visualize something I learned in Statistics class called the <i>Monte Carlo Method</i>. It is basically a way of approximating area or volume using randomly generated, uniformly distributed points. A more detailed explanation can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">here</a>. By finding the ratio between the points inside and outside the area we want to find, we can estimate area.</p>

                <p class="description">Built using the Godot Game engine in <em>Python</em>, this is a roguelike shoot-em-up project that i'm still working on. The part of this project I'm most proud of is a dungeon generator, which creates floors with a random number of neighbors and door ways.  <br><br> It's still a bit of a work in progress, and I have a lot of ideas on how to expand it and how to improve room generation. </p>

                <p class="description">This was a site I made a few years ago when I was still majoring in Game Design and Development, and features school projects made in <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, and <em>JavaScript</em>. Some of my favorite works are <i>My Garden!</i> where you build a zen garden and <i>NASA Space Image Generator</i> which uses NASA's APOD API to display different space images. This site was a great way to display work I made during the semester long class, as I learned many valuable skills in <em>Web Development</em>.</p>

                <p class="description">This was a portfolio site made for a class I took on <em>C#</em> and <em>Unity</em>. It features a compilation of assignments done during the class, including 2D and 3D, procedural generation, Perlin noise, boids, and more. All of this work was done entirely in the Unity Engine, and I gained valuable experience in Unity, which is used in many industries outside of just Game Development.</p>
